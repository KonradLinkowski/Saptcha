## Description

## Intro
Imagine that you are at the back of the Captcha system.

so now you have to match the pictures with the given name
to help websites test if the user is a Human or a malicious Robot.

## How to play
Select all images that look like the animal given by the name and than click verify.
For each correct answer you earn points
and you lose points for each mistake.
Earn points to unlock new types of animals.
